## Reporting a vulnerability

1. Do not open a public issue.
2. Email security@codex-cli.dev with a detailed description, reproduction steps, and any proof-of-concept scripts.
3. Include `SECURITY` in the subject line so the request is triaged quickly.
4. Expect an acknowledgment within three business days and a full response within ten business days.

## Preferred disclosures

- Provide minimal patches or mitigation ideas if you have them.
- Coordinate public disclosure timing with maintainers so users have a chance to update.
