# Contributing

Start with `docs/contributing.md` for the full workflow, coding standards, and testing expectations. Submit pull requests only after agreeing to `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

Quick recap:

1. Discuss changes in an issue before coding.
2. Keep branches small and focused on a single Milestone deliverable.
3. Follow the no-comments rule—favor descriptive names and pure functions instead.
4. Update docs, `.env.example`, and scripts whenever behavior changes.
5. Run `make lint`, `make test`, and `make e2e` locally before requesting review.
